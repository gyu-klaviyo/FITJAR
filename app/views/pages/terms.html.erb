			<h2>Creating a FITJAR Account</h2>
			<p>
			In order to access and use FITJAR, you will need to register and create an account (your "Account"). By creating an Account, you represent that you are at least 18 years old and able to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction (international accounts are welcome). When creating an Account, you may be required to provide certain personal information about yourself and will establish a username and a password. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about your Account.
			When creating an Account, you may not: provide any false personal information to us (including a false username) or create any account for anyone other than yourself without such other person's permission; use a username that is the name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; use a username that is subject to rights of another person without appropriate authorization; or use a username that is offensive, vulgar or obscene or otherwise in bad taste.
			We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, false or misleading or to reclaim any username that you create through the Service that violates our Terms. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Account, and agree to notify us if your password is lost, stolen, or disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. You are responsible for activities that occur under your Account.
			You can link your Account to various webmail, social networking, and other online accounts. You may only link your own accounts. We will access and retrieve your account information from these sites on your behalf (in some cases, by using your username and password) to make certain information or services available to you through the Service. By linking your other accounts, you expressly authorize us to access your account information from those third party accounts, on your behalf as your agent and permit us to access, use and, in some cases, store your account information to accomplish the foregoing.
